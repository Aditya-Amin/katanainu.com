They function as in-game items and are also tradeable for Ethereum or Katana Inu tokens on the NFT marketplace - which is also open for use by artists worldwide. Here we present to you our 2D NFTs. There are 50 unique traits for every collection here. We intend to convert them into 3D models for the game at random. If you secure any one of the 50 traits, we will airdrop you with its 3D NFT version for free.</p>
